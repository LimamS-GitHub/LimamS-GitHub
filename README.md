## Hi there 👋  

I'm a **Data Scientist** interested in building **data pipelines** and **machine learning models** to **analyze data and predict stuff**.

I enjoy working on projects that combine **data engineering**, **NLP**, and **real-world problem solving**.

### 🚀 Latest Projects — Must See  
If you check only two projects, make sure it’s these ones 👇

- **Job Offers & Skills Analyzer** &rarr; An end-to-end pipeline to extract, analyze, and match skills from job postings.  
- **Market Sentiment Analysis** &rarr; A sentiment-based analysis (and trading strategy) built on social media and financial NLP models.


These are my **latest projects**, both **technically challenging** and **fun to build**.
